                    <p>I have spent the last 15 years working in Finance/Operations, doing everything from Financial Analysis,
                        Operations Management, Credit Management, President and CEO of a theater upfit company, and most
                        recently an Operations Principal working with options trading and margin trading.
                    </p>
                    <p>I originally started my undergrad in IT, and ultimately decided on finance and management. The last few
                        years I have wanted to get back into the technology field, and this past year I was able to go back
                        to school and complete a Full Stack Coding program.</p>
                    <p>The more involved I became, the more I learned, the more I realized I enjoyed not only being involved
                        with the tech industry, but moreso the problem solving involved with coding.</p>

                    management. Since then I have worked as a credit manager, mortgage broker, owner of theater upfit company,

                <p>When i'm not working or studying, you will most likely find me skiing in the Park City mountains, mountain
                    biking in Big Cottonwood, water skiing, or training horses. Anything that involves getting outside and
                    getting active.

                    A group interactive game that pits friends against each other. Each player signs up, joins a game and is assigned a target.
                    The assassin must eliminate the target by using the camera on his/her phone. Once the target is eliminated,
                    the assassin receives the target's target. This continues until the last target is eliminated.

                    The game showcases the use of ReactJS and passport authentication and facial recognition on the client side. The server side

                    side, therefore keeping the site running efficiently and secure.
