                        <p>I have spent the last 15 years working in Finance/Operations, doing everything from Financial Analysis, Operations Management, Credit Management, President and CEO of a theater upfit company, and most recently an Operations Principal working with options trading and margin trading.
                        </p>
                        <p>I originally started my undergrad in IT, and ultimately decided on finance and management. The last
                            few years I have wanted to get back into the technology field, and this past year I was able
                            to go back to school and complete a Full Stack Coding program.</p>
                        <p>The more involved I became, the more I learned, the more I realized I enjoyed not only being involved with the tech industry, but moreso the problem solving involved with coding.</p>
