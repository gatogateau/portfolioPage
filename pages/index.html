                <p>Having graduated from the University of Utah with a degree in Economics, I started my career in
                    operations management.  Since then I have worked as a credit manager, mortgage broker, owner of
                    theater upfit company, and most recently and options principal
                </p>
                <p>When i'm not working or studying, you will most likely find me skiing in the Park City mountains,
                    mountain biking in Big Cottonwood, water skiing, or training horses.  Anything that involves getting 
                    outside and getting active.
